# Introduction

In this project, we aim to build a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior using demographic and behavioral data. The dataset utilized is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains information from direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution.


# Dataset

The Bank Marketing dataset includes data from direct marketing campaigns conducted via phone calls by a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

# Methodology


Data Preprocessing: Load the dataset and preprocess it by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Model Training: Train a decision tree classifier using the scikit-learn library.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: (Optional) Visualize the decision tree and feature importance.

# Conclusion

Summarize the findings and potential improvements for future work.
