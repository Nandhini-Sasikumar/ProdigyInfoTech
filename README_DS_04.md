# Introduction

This project aims to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. We use the Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled sentiment data for various entities in tweets.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains tweets labeled with sentiments such as positive, negative, and neutral. It includes columns for the tweet text, the entity mentioned, and the corresponding sentiment label.

# Methodology

### Data Collection

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, specifically the Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset. It includes tweets labeled with sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) and entities mentioned in the tweets.

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure the quality and accuracy of the analysis. 
The following steps are undertaken:

Data Cleaning: Removal of duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant columns. Special characters, emojis, and URLs are also removed from the tweet text.

Text Normalization: Converting text to lowercase, removing stop words, and lemmatization to normalize words to their base forms.

Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens, which is essential for subsequent analysis steps.

Entity Identification: Extracting and categorizing entities (e.g., brands, products) mentioned in the tweets for entity-specific sentiment analysis.

### Sentiment Analysis

The primary objective is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The following techniques and tools are used:

### Text Vectorization

Converting textual data into numerical format.

### Model Selection

Various machine learning models are explored, including:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Random Forest

Naive Bayes

### Model Training and Evaluation

The dataset is split into training and test sets. Models are trained on the training set and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

### Visualization

Data visualization helps in understanding the sentiment patterns and trends.

### Interpretation and Insights

The final step involves interpreting the visualizations and analysis results to draw meaningful insights. This includes:

Identifying key trends and patterns in public sentiment.

Understanding the impact of specific events on public opinion.

Making recommendations for stakeholders based on the analysis.

# Conclusion

The project concludes with a summary of findings, discussing the limitations of the analysis and suggesting potential improvements or future work, such as incorporating more sophisticated NLP techniques or expanding the dataset.
