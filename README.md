# Introduction
This project visualizes the population trends of countries using data from the World Bank. The dataset includes total population data from 1960 to the most recent year available for various countries.
This project aims to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. Specifically, we will explore the distribution of population data, such as the total population by age group or gender.
# Overview
Visualizing data distributions helps in understanding the characteristics of a dataset, identifying patterns, and making informed decisions. In this project, we will use data from the World Bank to create visualizations that represent the population distribution.
# Dataset

# Methodology
Data Collection: Download the dataset from the provided link.


Data Cleaning: Prepare the data by cleaning and organizing it for visualization.


Data Visualization: Use tools like Python's Matplotlib or Seaborn to create bar charts or histograms. These visualizations will represent the distribution of the population across different categories or age groups.
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of creating visualizations to represent data distributions. By visualizing population data, we can gain insights into demographic trends and other important factors. The final visualizations will provide a clear and concise representation of the population distribution, aiding in data analysis and decision-making.
