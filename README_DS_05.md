# Task 5

# Introduction
Traffic accidents are a significant concern for public safety, and understanding the factors that contribute to these incidents can help in developing effective prevention strategies. This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The goal is to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors, providing insights that can inform traffic management and safety measures.

# Overview

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial investigation to find patterns and relationships in the data.


Data Visualization: Visual representation of findings, including accident hotspots and contributing factors.


Conclusion: Summary of key findings and potential implications.


# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/road-traffic-accidents?select=cleaned.csv

Date and Time: Timestamp of the accident.


Location: Geographical location where the accident occurred.


Road Condition: Information about the condition of the road (e.g., wet, dry).


Weather Condition: Weather conditions at the time of the accident (e.g., clear, rainy).


Accident Severity: The severity of the accident (e.g., minor, major).


# Data Preprocessing


Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values.


Correcting inconsistent data entries.


Converting data types where necessary.


Feature Engineering:

Extracting additional features from existing data, such as Hour from the Time column.
Categorizing continuous variables to create meaningful groups (e.g., grouping times of day into morning, afternoon, evening).


Normalization:

Standardizing data formats, especially for categorical features.


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


Descriptive Statistics: Summary of the data to understand the distribution and central tendencies.


Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between different variables, such as how weather conditions correlate with accident severity.


Distribution Analysis: Exploring how accidents are distributed across different times, locations, and conditions.


# Data Visualization


Heatmaps and Geographic Plots: Visualizing accident hotspots based on location data.


Time Series Analysis: Plotting accident frequency by time to identify peak hours.


Bar Charts and Pie Charts: Showing the distribution of accidents across different road and weather conditions.


Severity Analysis: Visualizing the impact of various factors on the severity of accidents.


# Conclusion


Hotspot Identification: Certain locations have a higher frequency of accidents, indicating potential areas for targeted interventions.


Temporal Patterns: Specific times of day, particularly during peak hours, show higher accident rates.


Impact of Weather and Road Conditions: Adverse weather and poor road conditions are significant contributors to the likelihood and severity of accidents.
